# VPet-Simulator Tutorial

**This tutorial only automatically opens the first time you start the program and when you start it after an update** 
*If you can see this file automatically open every time you start Desktop pet, that is a bug. Please report it to me*

[Data Calculation](#Data Calculation), which affects the attribute changes for the Virtual Pet, is on by default, but can be toggled under System > Interact. Data Collection toggles whether or not consumption of the Virutal Pet's attributes, such as stamina, mood, hunger, and thirst, is on. 

The core gameplay is the progression of the Virtual Pet, while automatic actions such as walking around, dazing, crouching, and so on needs the player to be present to witness them.

### Data Calculation

While the program is running, Virtual Pet will have a series of needs, such as Mood, Hunger, and Thirst. If you just want to just observe the Virtual Pet without worrying about these needs, turn off data calculation.

### Computing between

Calculate Virtual Pet Data Calculation interval. The longer the interval, the longer the frequency of Virtual Pet interactions and the lower the rate of Consumption. Adjust this to your preference.

* If you only want to feed the Virtual Pet occasionally, a longer calculation interval is better.
* If you want to Virtual Pet grow faster, a shorter calculation interval is better.

### Interaction Cycles

Decide after how many Data Calculation cycles the Virtual Pet decides to automatically move around. The longer the cycles, the lower the frequency of interactions.

### Virtual Pet moving

Decide whether the Virtual Pet is allowed to perform displacement action, and the Virtual Pet will not move and stay put after closing.

#### Smart Moving

When turned on, the Virtual Pet will only move with player interaction, otherwise it will stay where it is.
